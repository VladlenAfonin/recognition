# Voice recognition project

## Description

Here I implement and study voice recognition methods.
The idea is to implementation a variety of speaker recognition methods with explanations and results discussion.

## About Datasets

Currently datasets used are from [Abhijeet Kumar's article](https://appliedmachinelearning.blog/2017/11/14/spoken-speaker-identification-based-on-gaussian-mixture-models-python-implementation/).
Addition to this dataset is now in development.

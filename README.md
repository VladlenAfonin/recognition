# Voice recognition project

## Description

Here I implement and study voice recognition methods.
The idea is to implementation a variety of speaker recognition methods with explanations and results discussion.

## Progress

Checklist of things done:

- [x] Classic GMM gender-recognition approach (see classic_gmm_gr.ipynb)
- [x] Classic GMM voice-recognition approach (see classic_gmm_vr.ipynb)
- [x] GMM-UBM gender-recognition approach (see map_adaptation_gr.ipynb)
- [ ] GMM-UBM voice-recognition approach
- [ ] Supervector based GMM-UBM voice-recognition approach
- [ ] GMM-UBM/i-vector approach

## About Datasets

Currently datasets used are from [Abhijeet Kumar's article](https://appliedmachinelearning.blog/2017/11/14/spoken-speaker-identification-based-on-gaussian-mixture-models-python-implementation/).
Addition to this dataset is now in development.
